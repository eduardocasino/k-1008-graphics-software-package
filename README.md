# K-1008 Graphics Software Package

## Introduction

This repository contains the sources, in their original assembly format, listings and assembled programs that came with MTU's Graphics Software Package for the K-1008 "Visable" memory card for the KIM-1.

Please refer to the [original documentation](http://retro.hansotten.nl/6502-sbc/kim-1-manuals-and-software/kim-1-related-hardware/mtu-k-1012-k-1008/mtu-k-1008/) for usage information.

(This is a Work In Progress, currently just the SWIRL and VMLIF programs are completed)

## Licensing

Although it probably doesn't have any significance nowadays, as this software is meant for a very obsolete and rare piece of hardware, this material is copyrighted by MICRO TECHNOLOGY UNLIMITED, a company that is [still in business](http://www.mtu.com/catalog/index.php). I've put it here just to be of assistance to the owners of a K-1008 card.

See the original LICENSE.md file for details.
