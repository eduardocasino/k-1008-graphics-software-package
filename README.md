# K-1008 Graphics Software Package

## Introduction

This repository contains the manual facsimile, the sources in their original assembly format, listings and assembled programs that came with MTU's Graphics Software Package for the K-1008 "Visable" memory card for the KIM-1.

## Licensing

Although it probably doesn't have any significance nowadays, as this software is meant for a very obsolete and rare piece of hardware, this material is copyrighted by MICRO TECHNOLOGY UNLIMITED, a company that is [still in business](http://www.mtu.com/catalog/index.php). I've put it here just to be of assistance to the owners of a K-1008 card.

See the original LICENSE.md file for details.
